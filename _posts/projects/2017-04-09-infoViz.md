<p>Drivers from all over come to Le Mans, France to take part in the oldest sports car endurance race in the world, around the Circuit de la Sarthe, the 24 hours of Le Mans. Beginning in 1923, a 2978cc 4 cylinder engine powered a Chenard & Walcker Sport to win the first ever 24 hours of Le Mans. The car traveled a total distance of 2209.536 km with an average speed of 92.064 km/h with A. Lagache and R. Léonard behind the wheel. Compare that to 2017 when T.Bernhard, E.Bamber, and B.Hartley took the Porsche 919 hybrid and its 2000cc 4 cylinder turbo engine a total distance of 5001.23 km with an average speed of 208.206 km/h and Porsche’s record 19th win. Track and technology changes have made the endurance race not only faster but also safer.
<br><br>
The goal of the visualisation is to present a way for users to see changes that have been made with regards to cars participating in each race and their performance as well as the results of changes made to the track layouts for safety purposes.
<br><br>
The data on which the visualisation is based on is the history of the 24 Hours of Lemans from the year 1923 to 2017 which includes data on the winning car of that year, achievements made by the winning car, and information regarding the race/track for each year.
