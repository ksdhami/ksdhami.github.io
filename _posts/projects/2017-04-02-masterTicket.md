<p>Third-party scalpers are a serious problem when it comes to dealings between fans and promoters/artists. Master Ticket looks to maintain the connection between the seller and the consumer while making the possibility of scalper interference as difficult as possible. With Master Ticket, promoters directly create events and tickets for fans. Meanwhile, fans will be able to buy tickets and only transfer their ticket for a price that is less than or equal to the value they paid for it. Master Ticket looks to promote and preserve the integral relationship between promoters/artists and fans, built upon the transparency of dealings and unencumbered value to both parties involved.
