<p>Don't have a car or hate taking public transportation to university. Maybe you do have a car but feel a little lonely during your commute. That's where School Carpool comes in. School Carpool is designed to assist university students in their daily commute to and from campus by connecting students with one another based on the schedules, courses, and other social features such as taste in music.  
<br> <br>
No one wants to be stuck in a car with someone who the would otherwise never interact with. The value proposition that our system School Carpool provides, over other similar apps, is the ability to find other students based on social preference such as their taste in music. This is a unique way for the student to not only express themselves, but also be able to quickly decide whether or not they will get along with the drivers/passengers they find through the app. By having a social and fun way to connect people is a critical benefit that School Carpool offers.
