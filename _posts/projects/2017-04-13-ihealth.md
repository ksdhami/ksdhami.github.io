<p>So imagine you are one in a billion currently living in sub Saharan Africa, where there is only a 24% internet adoption rate. You have to take your sick child to a local doctor, who requires specific health information in order to proceed with treatment. Without knowledge of this information, the doctor must go through stacks of paper to try and retrieve this information. But what if the doctor still can’t find the patient’s medical records? The problem they face today is that there is currently no integrated health data system shared between clinics yet. Without an adequate system to record and retrieve health data, treatment is delayed, leading to misdiagnosis and administration errors.
<br><br>
Therefore, to solve this problem, we’ve developed our own medical record solution, the iHealth Card. This is a secure physical card patients will have that electronically stores their health information. Records can be accessed by physicians using an Android application which will provide the most crucial info regarding patient and medical histories.
<br><br>
The app will show a patient’s medical profile, which includes their medical conditions, surgical history, and family history. Doctors are required to fill in when the symptoms started to occur, date, and diagnostics, with the ability to either remove or edit entries if needed. The app also informs other doctors about previous prescriptions and recent visits. Additionally, there is a camera functionality that doctors may utilize to keep track of records and take a snapshot of the patient’s symptoms.
