<!-- Modern life standards make people more mobile as well as lonely -->

<!-- In order for innovation to prosper, ideas must be shared, iterated, killed, executed and everything else in between. Fashion is a major talking point in terms of sustainability, personal expression and something we have to deal with day in and day out, and to not see this as a focal point to leverage technology on top of, is foolish -->


<!-- all focused around improving the user experience, showcasing unknown use cases and lastly, tackling the larger issue of sustainability in the fashion industry utilizing technology -->
