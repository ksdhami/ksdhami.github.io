<p>To unlock your smartphone you will probably have to enter some pin code or pattern. Maybe you use your fingerprint or face. What if unlocking your phone can be more engaging and even fun. Here are two alternative ways to unlock you smartphone.
<br> <br>
The first uses traditional touch input. The user will play a quick game of "Where's Waldo" where they must find and touch all Waldo's within a pixelated photo taken from the user's phone gallery. If the user selects the wrong character, that is not a Waldo, the screen will display an appropriate message and reset the 'game'. 
<br><br>
The second uses the smartphones accelerometer, gyroscope, and light sensors. The user must move the smartphone in the correct direction, moving the eyes on the screen, and finally covering the smartphones light sensors, putting the eyes to sleep, for the smartphone to unlock. The user also has the ability to change the appearance of the eyes by quickly moving turning the phone upside down and back right side up.
