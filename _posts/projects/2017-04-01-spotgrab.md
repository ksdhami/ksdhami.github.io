<p>Connecting employers with the right people and skills when needed the most. <br> <br> Absenteeism can cost the Canadian economy approximately $16.6 billion a year with 98% of employers handling consistent absenteeism in their day to day operations. Likewise, there are many employees looking for extra work/cash, whether itâ€™s because of changing schedules or limited employment opportunities. SpotGrab looks to create an on-demand service that acts as a liaison for employers to network with vetted and trained employees to fill in empty shifts.
