<p>Whether you're at work, on a lovely dinner date, or anything in between chances are you have a bag for it. However, what if your day is packed full of events. Well, you would probably have to carry a different bag for each different occasion and that can have its issues. More bags means more money being spent. On a global sense, it also means that there is overconsumption and overproduction.  
<br><br>
That is where the Chameleon Bag comes in. A bag that can transform it's size and pattern to your personal needs. With the Chameleon Bag, you get an all-in-one sophisticated design with everyday use in mind. The user can control the appearance of the bag with an integrated touch button that will reveal/conceal panels that change the aesthetics of the bag. The user can also manually change the shape of the bag to meet their space needs.
<br><br>
The Chameleon Bag offers a multipurpose solution that caters to a minimalist lifestyle where less is more.

In order for innovation to prosper, ideas must be shared, iterated, killed, executed and everything else in between. Fashion is a major talking point in terms of sustainability, personal expression and something we have to deal with day in and day out, and to not see this as a focal point to leverage technology on top of, is foolish

all focused around improving the user experience, showcasing unknown use cases and lastly, tackling the larger issue of sustainability in the fashion industry utilizing technology
