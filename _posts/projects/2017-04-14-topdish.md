<p>As the world becomes more globalised and people begin to travel away their homes, they tend to spend more time away from their loved ones. This can eventually make someone start to feel lonely and long for that personal human connection either from a boyfriend/girlfriend/spouse, friend, or parent. 
<br><br>
Our solution to this is the U&I Jacket. It's a jacket that allows loved ones to stay connected when they are not physically in contact with each other. 
<br><br>
The U&I Jacket can work in two ways. First, U&I Jacket owners can place their hands into their pockets and send a signal to each other that they want to hold hands. Then both owners will feel haptic feedback that will simulate physical hand holding and therefore give them the feeling of being connected. Second, someone who does not own the jacket can use the companion application to send a personalised signal to an owners shoulder and/or upper-back. The U&I Jacket owner will then feel that haptic touch sent to them, giving them the physical support they want.

In order for innovation to prosper, ideas must be shared, iterated, killed, executed and everything else in between. Fashion is a major talking point in terms of sustainability, personal expression and something we have to deal with day in and day out, and to not see this as a focal point to leverage technology on top of, is foolish
