Top Dish YYC is interested in analyzing Calgaryâ€™s food scene in fine detail. It collaborates with food bloggers and diners in Calgary who provide them with detailed reviews on the dishes they ordered at a restaurant. Their goal is to help users see what the best dish is at a restaurant. 
<br><br>
Have you ever been to a restaurant and not known what to order? The Top Dish YYC app will solve your issue by helping you through this process! The Top Dish YYC app is a platform where users can easily access the information on restaurants, reviews of dishes, sign up to be a partnered diner with Top Dish, enter reviews and have them featured on the app. For the purposes of the app, all diners collaborating with Top Dish YYC will be signed up users. By providing signed up users with access to Top Dish on their phones, the company will remove the extra step of going to their website to review dishes for restaurants, thus making it convenient for diners to engage with the company service. Additionally, the app will allow new users that are not signed up to access all the information listed above, however, they will not be allowed to review dishes or get exclusive offers or gifts cards from the company.
<br><br>
The primary target for this app is the Top Dish YYC diner base. The main purpose is to make it easier for the existing diner base to engage in providing feedback for restaurants and dishes while receiving promotions and offers in return. The app will also allow the them to expand their diner base more easily, and gain a secondary audience who use the app for knowing what the best dish at a restaurant is, but not necessarily review them. Top Dish YYC hopes that by the means of the app, they can make their review form and exclusive offers more accessible to diners, thus, driving in more crowds to the restaurants with whom they have partnered with.

In order for innovation to prosper, ideas must be shared, iterated, killed, executed and everything else in between. Fashion is a major talking point in terms of sustainability, personal expression and something we have to deal with day in and day out, and to not see this as a focal point to leverage technology on top of, is foolish
