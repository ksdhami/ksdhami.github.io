<p>Have you ever walked into your house from a long day out, and decided to do some laundry. 

During the course, we dive into more detail regarding the design process through various projects. More precisley we explore, refine, and communicate design ideas through use of sketching. These sketches are then implemented through software and physical prototypes, creating highly interactive human computer interfaces which are used as solutions to a variety of real-world problems.
<br> <br>
Projects include creating a softare application where the central interaction is a singular button where the interaction represents some aspect of a clients personality or character, two alternative ways to unlock a mobile device where one relies soley on touch/gesture input and the other relies soley on sensor input, a physical Arduino prototype that solves an everyday problem, and a fashion tech garment with Arduino.
