<p>Have you ever wanted to go out, only to realise that you can't find your keys. You look everywhere and finally find them in your just washed pants. Seems like you forgot to take them out of your pant pockets the last time you came home. What if there was a way to remind you to take your keys and hang them up whenever you enter your house.
<br> <br>
Here is a simple prototype made with an Arduino that can solve this very problem. Using a simple wooden box to house a PIR motion sensor on it's side that will detect whether someone walks past the key hook. If no key is/was taken or someone takes a key when leaving, nothing will happen. If someone walks past the key hook, and a key was previously taken, then, after some delay, a melody will go off, warning the person to put their key back on the hook. There are also indicator lights above the hooks, red for missing and green for present, as well as a button to turn the sound off.
