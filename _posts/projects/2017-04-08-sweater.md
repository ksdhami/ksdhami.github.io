<p>Sometimes you just want to go to a mall and browse around without someone immediatley coming up to you and asking 'is there anything I can help you with?'. What is there was someone fashion garment that you could wear that would answer that question for you without you needing to do anything. 
<br> <br>
Using an Arduino along with a ultrasonic range finder imbedded into a sweater, it will detect if a store employee approaches you from behind. Once they are close enough, an LED message will display stating that you are "Just Browsing", telling them to kindly leave you alone. 
<br><br>
The sweater is stylised in a punk manner, giving it a distressed aesthetic, similar to the feeling someone might have when constantly being asked if they require any help when they are just looking around.
