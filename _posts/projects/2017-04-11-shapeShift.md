<p>Throughout history we can see that fashion has shifted and evolved not only for men and women but also the differences between the two. With this project, we envision the future of fashion to be normcore, a unisex fashion trend where the wearer chooses clothing that is unpretentious and not overly stylized. 
<br><br>
Here we present the Shape Shifter, a unisex top with multiple layers that utilises technology to change the look and feel of the garment itself. Using temperature and humidity sensors, the sleeves of the top will seperate and drop down, revealing the inner, more breathable layer when temperatures reach an upper threshold. This also creates a different style of top from the one before. When the temperature begins to drop, the sleeves will retract to their normal position, with the outer layer sleeves now covering more of the wearer.
<br><br>
With the Shape Shifter we have fashion, function, and comfort in a single garment.

In order for innovation to prosper, ideas must be shared, iterated, killed, executed and everything else in between. Fashion is a major talking point in terms of sustainability, personal expression and something we have to deal with day in and day out, and to not see this as a focal point to leverage technology on top of, is foolish

<!-- 
all focused around improving the user experience, showcasing unknown use cases and lastly, tackling the larger issue of sustainability in the fashion industry utilizing technology
